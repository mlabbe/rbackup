# Frogtoss rbackup script config file.
# The idea is that the script is run on the client, which sends
# the files to the backup server voluntarily.
#
# Format of this config file is:
# edict: parameter
# Where EDICT is some feature of the program, and parameter
# is how the EDICT is handled.

#
# NEW v1.1
#
# How to upgrade your config to a new version of rbackup: Search
# through this config file for every copy of NEW v#.#, where #.# is
# the version number where the config option first appeared.
# Incorporate this into your active config.
#
# After this, change the 'version' edict to the current version of the
# program.  If you don't know what that is, look at the VERSION
# constant in rbackup.pl.
#
# NEW v1.3
#
# Multiple local Subversion databases have been added
#

# the files will be backed up to.
targetdir: localhost:/home/backup/somedir

# errormsg is a file that gets appended to when an error occurs with
# the details of the message.  This message is on the workstations.
# The intention is for the administrator to find an error out on the
# server, and to look for the diagnosis in this file.
errorlog: /home/backup/rbackup/rbackup-error.log

# rsyncprogram is the path and file to the local rsync binary
rsyncprogram: /usr/bin/rsync --progress

# If this equals true, then rsync will compress when
# sending over the network. 1 = true, 0 = false
rsynccompress: 0

# remoteshell is the server's remote shell to employ.
# Do not change this from the default unless you know what you are doing!
# Using a shell other than ssh could result in a security breach.
remoteshell: /usr/bin/ssh

# version is the version of the program the config file was made for.
# If the version of the program is different, the program won't run.
# Consult your admin/the documentation for the changes between program
# versions before blindly updating this in case the config file is not 
# directly forward compatible.
version: 1.5

# NEW v1.1
#
# Back up the config file on every backup, whether it's specified
# below or not.  You have to explicitly set this to 'no' to not do it.
# There is rarely a good reason as to why you wouldn't want to back up
# your config.

# NEW v1.1
#
#
# Send a file across the network called .lastbackuptime, which

# backup's completion.  This can be used by programs on the server to
# notify admins of machines when backups have been missed.
#
# On unless this is set to 'no'.
lastbackuptime: yes

# Dump mysql database to this file (which can be backed up below)
# Set to 'Yes' to do it.  Anything else will disable.
# Remember to keep the permissions good and well on this file!

# List of directories and files to back up.

# Although this will be going to the command line through a system() call,
# do NOT use '~' or $HOME, as the later versions of rbackup may not be running

# Some usage examples:
#
# BACK UP A DIR CALLED 'cpp' (note the lack of trailing '/' is required!!)

# BACK UP A FILE CALLED 'time.mp3'

# BACK UP A DIR WITH SPACES IN THE NAME
